      <h3>Why My Dog Trainer Should Adapt the Subscription Model</h3>
      <p>
        Last year my wife and I rescued our dog Tucker from the local animal shelter. He was 4 months old at the time and everything he did was cute; even the bad stuff! However, as time went on the behavioral issues became less comical, we became concerned, and scheduled an in-home training session. Our trainer Karen was great to work with and we immediately had a better understanding of how to manage his behavior at home.
  <br />  <br />
        But Karen’s support didn’t stop there! She let us know we could text her outside of the training session to ask questions about anything we covered or any new behaviors we were doing. And here is the kicker… she offered this ongoing support for FREE!
  <br />  <br />
        Now this got my wheels turning and my gut tells me that dog trainers (like Karen) should be experimenting with the subscription business model which is becoming increasingly popular.
  <br />  <br />
        We live in the world of $10/ month streaming subscriptions and unlimited Panera coffee for $8/ month. I pay $100 extra/ month at my gym to have access to their training app and communicate with my trainer on the app outside of my sessions. He helps me with ongoing questions around body pain and stretching.
  <br />  <br />
        So how would this apply to dog trainers? The ongoing advice dog trainers provide is easily worth $10-35 a month and has the potential to be a great additional revenue source for their business. And yes, my gut tells me people would pay!
  <br />  <br />
        Having just recently gone through dealing with dog behavioral issue I know how tough dealing with those issues can be. Not knowing where to turn to for advice and wondering if the investment in training would pay off caused a lot of stress and anxiety. But once we committed to getting help with training, having the ongoing support has been extremely valuable! I’m not sure Karen will convince us to schedule another in-home sessions (cost was about $300/ hr), but I guarantee she would get $300+ from me over the next 24 months from an ongoing monthly support subscription.
  <br />  <br />
        If dog trainers started marketing $14.99 per month text & email support, and 50 clients took advantage that’s $750 per month ($9,000 per year) in additional revenue. That’s significant for a small business owner! Now not every client is going to use the support consistently, but that’s how subscriptions work. The value is having the option to use it and the peace of mind that it’s there. I pay $6 a month for Disney+ and rarely watch it. I keep it for the 5-6 times a year I do watch something on there. I think the same principal would apply here.
  <br />  <br />
        I did share my idea with Karen and the verdict is out on whether or not she will implement this strategy into her business. I think it could be very profitable for her and for other dog trainers around the world.
