      <h3>Imposter Syndrome</h3>
      <p>
      It’s easy to struggle with imposter syndrome when we are pursuing our goals and working on projects that challenge us. It’s easy to look around and assume that others are better qualified and more talented than us. These feelings of self-doubt can be crippling, cause us to give-up, and retreat to more comfortable areas of our lives. Often these insecurities are deeply rooted and a byproduct of events from our childhood.
    <br />    <br />
      So how do we cope with imposter syndrome?
  <br />    <br />
      From my perspective, we start by focusing only on the goals and projects that truly motivate us. Not the goals our family, friends, or community subscribe to us, but rather the goals which stoke a fire within us and invoke our curiosity.
  <br />    <br />
      Now this shift may result in some tough conversations and strained relationships. Being honest with ourselves and others about what truly motivates us will do that. But I believe this shift allows us to push through when imposter syndrome starts to reveal its ugly head- it’s a crucial step to coping. And it works because it awakens internal forces- equally as strong as imposter syndrome- capable of suppressing those feelings of inferiority. 
  <br />    <br />
      So here’s to pursuing the things that truly motivate us and following our curiosity in 2021 and beyond!
