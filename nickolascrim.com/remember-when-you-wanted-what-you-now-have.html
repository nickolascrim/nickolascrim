      <h3>Remember When You Wanted What You Now Have</h3>
      <p>
      I don’t remember where I heard/ read this, but it had an impact on me. So recently I went through the mental exercise and reflected on a time when I wanted what I now have- a relationship, job, financial goal.
<br />  <br />
      The exercise reminded me of the material things, opportunities, and relationships I wanted and now had! Just with food, clothing, shelter, and family I have been given a lot. Yet I still struggle with contentment. You have to work at contentment and I have a lot of work to do!
<br />  <br />
      Then I thought about reaching a level of gratefulness where I would be comfortable if all the blessings went away. I asked myself if I would find peace in knowing there was a time when I didn't have those things (I simply wanted them) and be thankful for the time I had them. To me that is true gratefulness and something I'm striving for!
<br />  <br />
      We aren't promised tomorrow and life is too short to NOT be thankful for what we've been given. The things at one time we didn’t have but wanted!
