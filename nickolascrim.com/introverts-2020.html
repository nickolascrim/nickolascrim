      <h3>Year of the Introvert</h3>
      <p>
        2020 has been the year of the introvert. What do I mean by this? For those who are comfortable being alone- preferring quiet solitude over external stimulation- this year has had many advantages. Many of us have worked from home, had few social events to participate in, and ample time to be alone reading, thinking, pondering, hobbying, or hanging out with those relationships we cherish most. This year has allowed for more time outside enjoying nature and time on the internet learning from and connecting with interesting people all over the world. With nowhere to go and without the usual things to do people have been more open to trying new socially distanced activities- we have discovered we enjoy hiking- and more responsive to texts, emails, direct messages, and posts from a stranger. For those of us more comfortable banging out our thoughts on a keyboard v. shouting them out in a loud and crowded venue, this year has been a breath of fresh air. On a side note, I have always been impressed by people who can form a complete thought and communicate it clearly in a room with a dB level exceeding what's medically safe. That is not my super power.
      <br /> <br />
        The reality for introverts is we live in an extroverted world. What extroverts have felt during 2020- consistently forced into uncomfortable environments, asked to communicate in challenging/ less natural ways, feeling unequipped to thrive in the current environment- are all challenges introverts are faced with almost daily in a “normal” year. Quite frankly it's draining and we don’t always feel the love and support from our more extroverted friends and colleagues. But I digress.
    <br /> <br />
        Now I don’t expect the world to throw away its extroverted ways and cater to introverts' every want and need, however I am optimistic that many of the shifts this year has brought will stick around. The world needs ways of working, communicating, and recreating which cater to both extroverts and introverts; one is not superior to the other. I’m hopeful this year has opened more people's minds to some of the challenges introverts face and that our preferred way of living, working, and communicating is effective and brings some unique advantages.
    <br /> <br />
        So here's to 2021 a great year to be both an introvert and extrovert!
