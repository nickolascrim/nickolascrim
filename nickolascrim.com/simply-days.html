      <h3>From Now On They're Simply Days</h3>
      <p>
        For me, most days of the week come with preconceived ideas about what I should be doing and what can be accomplished.
        <br />  <br />
        Here are some examples.
<br />  <br />
        • Monday… this is a day to hate. Monday is for commuting, boring meetings, and getting caught up after the weekend. No real work or projects are accomplished on Mondays.
<br />  <br />
        • Wednesday… this is “hump day”. The middle of the work week when productivity is supposed to be at it’s peak. Just make it through the day and then things will start to “wind down”.
<br />  <br />
        • Friday… this is a day to wrap up the work week and determine what can be pushed off until Monday or onto someone else’s plate. It’s preparation for the weekend.
<br />  <br />
        • Saturday… work is optional this day. Free from work obligations, this is the day to pursue hobbies, personal errands, or explore new places. Nothing really productive happens on Saturday.
<br />  <br />
        Now I understand many of these are my own preconceived ideas and I take a cynical view. Others may think about and approach a particular day much differently. However, my gut tells me that many of us get stuck in this line of thinking and it limits what we can accomplish on any given day. From my experience this thinking is common in my circle of influence.
<br />  <br />
        So, going forward I am throwing out “Monday-Saturday” and will start approaching each new day as a “day”. Sunday will be the exception for religious reasons. My goal is to transition away from my preconceived ideas and approach each day with a new perspective and the possibilities it brings.
<br />  <br />
        Here are some examples.
<br />  <br />
        • Monday… this could be a deep workday. Decline the routine meetings (as many as you can at least), skip the “getting caught up” tasks, and dive into an important project which you have been putting off, but has long term growth potential. Monday could be writing day if you’re into that. Clear the afternoon to tidy up the house, do laundry, or prep and cook a fabulous meal.
<br />  <br />
        • Wednesday… this could be a day to slow down, rest, and reset. Clear the afternoon to focus on your health, family, hobbies, personal errands, or passion projects. Make Wednesday reading day when you focus on reading, thinking, and contemplating the ideas in the books you own, newsletters you subscribe to, and even your social media feeds (I like twitter for this reason).
<br />  <br />
        • Friday… wind UP and get a jump on things! Don’t push off projects for another day or start overscheduling next week. Set boundaries, get those projects done as quickly as possible, and focus on tweak and improve things another day.
<br />  <br />
        • Saturday… when others are in “weekend mode” you can use part of the day to be productive and focus on special project. Get up early. Do the work you missed on Wednesday with a different mindset and free of distractions. Dive into that interesting course or certification you’ve been wanting to pursue. Host a lunch with interesting people to discuss long term goals and aspirations.
<br />  <br />
        Now these are just some of my ideas. Not every example will fit everyone’s schedule, lifestyle, or aspirations. That’s not the point. The goal is to throw away the preconceived ideas and approach each day with a new perspective on what can be accomplished.
<br />  <br />
        Let's avoid writing off an amazing opportunity, project, or experience, because of the name of a day!
